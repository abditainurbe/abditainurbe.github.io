My name is Peter YI WEI (Chinese: 韋禕). Currently I am a third year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://math.wisc.edu/), advised by [Michael Kemeny](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~kemeny/homepage.html).

I work on algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry. More specifically, I'm interested in the following:

*. Geometry of syzygies of curves.
*. Geometry of algebraic surfaces, especially K3 surfaces.
*. Rational points on curves and surfaces.

In summer 2019, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) supervised by [Baohua Fu](http://www.mcm.ac.cn/faculty/fbh/201805/t20180528_408541.html).
